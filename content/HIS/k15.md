### Anemia Penyakit Kronik

Anemia is commonly associated with systemic diseases, including chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infections such as tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus infection, and malignancies.

#### Laboratory Diagnosis

The peripheral blood picture in anemia of chronic inflammation is that of a mild anemia, with hemoglobin concentration usually 8 to 10 g/dL and without reticulocytosis.

The cells are usually normocytic and normochromic. Although microcytosis and hypochromia can be seen, they typically represent coexistent iron deficiency. The inflammatory condition leading to the anemia also may cause leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or both.

Iron studies show low serum iron and TIBC values. Because hepatocyte production of transferrin is regulated by intracellular iron levels, the low TIBC (an indirect measure of transferrin) reflects the abundant iron stores in hepatocytes. The transferrin saturation may be normal or low. The serum ferritin level, as an acute phase reactant, is usually increased beyond the value that would be expected for the same patient in the absence of the inflammatory condition. It may not be outside the reference interval, but it is nevertheless increased.

#### Treatment

Therapeutic administration of erythropoietin can correct anemia of chronic inflammation,47 but iron must be administered concurrently because stored body iron remains sequestered and unavailable (i.e., functional iron deficiency).
