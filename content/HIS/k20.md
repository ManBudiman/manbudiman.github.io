Thalassemias are a group of heterogeneous disorders in which one or more globin chains are reduced or absent. Thalassemias result in a hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to decreased production of hemoglobin. The imbalance of globin chain synthesis causes an excess of the normally produced globin chain that damages the RBCs or their precursors and results in premature hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis.

Types of genetic defects resulting in thalassemia:
- Reduced or absent transcription of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
- mRNA processing errors
- Translation errors 
- Deletion of one or more globin genes

### Pathophysiology

In β-thalassemia, unpaired, excess a chains precipitate in developing erythroid precursors forming inclusion bodies; this causes oxidative stress and damage to cellular membranes. Apoptosis is triggered, and the damaged and apoptotic erythroid precursors are subsequently phagocytized and destroyed in the bone marrow by activated macrophages.

In this situation, the bone marrow attempts to produce RBCs but is not able to release sufficient viable cells into the circulation. The cells that are released into the periphery are laden with inclusion bodies and are rapidly sequestered and destroyed by macrophages in the spleen (extravascular hemolysis).9 Therefore in b-thalassemia the anemia is multifactorial and results from ineffective production and increased destruction.

Typically, individuals with severe β-thalassemia are asymptomatic during fetal life and through approximately 6 months of age because Hb F (α2γ2) is the predominant hemoglobin. Symptoms usually begin to appear between 6 and 24 months of age, after completion of the γ to β switch. To compensate for the decreased expression of the β-globin gene, the γ- and/or δ-globin genes are usually upregulated; however, in β-thalassemia major, this increase is insufficient to correct the α/β chain imbalance.

In β-thalassemia major, profound anemia stimulates an increase in erythropoietin (EPO) production by the kidney and results in massive (but ineffective) erythroid hyperplasia. In untreated or inadequately treated patients, marked bone changes and deformities occur due to massive bone marrow expansion. Reduction in bone mineral density and thinning of the cortex of bone increases the risk of pathologic fractures. Skull radiographs may demonstrate a typical “hair on end” appearance due to vertical striations of bony trabeculae.

Iron accumulation in various organs is a serious complication in β-thalassemia major and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. Iron overload is predominantly due to the regular RBC transfusions required in β-thalassemia major.

### Clinical Syndromes

- β-thalassemia silent carrier (heterozygous state), with no hematologic abnormalities or clinical symptoms
- β-thalassemia minor (heterozygous state), with mild hemolytic anemia, microcytic and hypochromic RBCs, and no clinical symptoms
- β-thalassemia intermedia, with mild to moderate hemolytic anemia, microcytic and hypochromic RBCs, moderate clinical symptoms, and non-transfusion dependence
- β-thalassemia major (homozygous or compound heterozygous state), with severe hemolytic anemia, microcytic and hypochromic RBCs, severe clinical symptoms, and transfusion dependence

## α-Thalassemia

### Pathophysiology

In α-thalassemia, decreased production of α chains can manifest in utero because α chains are a component of both fetal and adult hemoglobins. However, the accumulation of non-α chains has different consequences compared to β-thalassemia.

In the fetus and newborn, a decrease in production of α chains results in an excess of γ chains. These γ chains accumulate in proportion to the number of deleted or defective α genes. The γ chains are more stable and do not precipitate, but instead form hemoglobin tetramers (γ4) called Hb Bart.

After 6 months of age and through adulthood, when the γ to β switch is completed, the decrease in a chain production results in excess β chains. The excess β chains are also relatively stable and form tetramers (β4), called Hb H.

Because Hb H and Hb Bart do not precipitate to any significant degree in developing erythroid precursors in bone marrow, patients with α-thalassemia do not have severe ineffective erythropoiesis. As mature RBCs age in the circulation, however, β4 tetramers in Hb H eventually precipitate and form inclusion bodies. Macrophages in the spleen recognize and remove these abnormal RBCs from the circulation, and the patient manifests a moderate hemolytic anemia.

Hb Bart and Hb H cannot deliver oxygen to tissues due to their very high affinity for oxygen. A fetus cannot survive with only Hb Bart (found with a deletion of all four α-globin genes). The marked tissue hypoxia causes heart failure and massive edema (hydrops fetalis) and hepatomegaly, and the fetus usually dies in uteroor shortly after birth.

### Clinical Syndromes

- Silent carrier state
- α-thalassemia minor
- Hb H disease
- Hb Bart hydrops fetalis syndrome
