### Rangkuman

What it is: Reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity due to:
- Low hemoglobin/RBCs (most common)
- Impaired hemoglobin function

Key Mechanisms:
- Production Problems
	- Ineffective: Defective RBCs die in bone marrow (e.g., B₁₂/folate deficiency, thalassemia)
	- Insufficient: Too few RBCs made (e.g., iron deficiency, kidney disease)

- Blood Loss
	- Acute (trauma) or chronic (e.g., gut bleeding → iron loss)

- RBC Destruction
	- Hemolysis from infections, antibodies, or genetic defects (e.g., sickle cell)

Body’s Adaptations:
- Fast (minutes-hours): ↑ Heart rate, prioritized blood flow to vital organs
- Slow (days-weeks): ↑ Erythropoietin, RBC production, and oxygen release via 2,3-BPG

A functional definition of anemia is a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. It can arise if there is insufficient hemoglobin or the hemoglobin has impaired function. The former is the more frequent cause. Anemia is defined operationally as a reduction in the hemoglobin content of blood that can be caused by a decrease in the RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit below the reference interval for healthy individuals of similar age, sex, and race, under similar environmental conditions. 

**Adaptations to Anemia**

Response to Acute Blood Loss, occur in minutes to hours:
-  Increase in heart rate, respiratory rate, and cardiac output, which increases the flow of oxygenated blood
- Redistribution of blood flow from skin to essential organs (brain, heart, muscles)

Response to Slowly Developing Anemia, occur over days to weeks:
- Increase in erythrocyte 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate which decreases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen and allows more oxygen release to tissues
- Increase in erythropoietin production by kidneys, which increases erythropoiesis and promotes release of more red blood cells into circulation

### Mechanisms of Anemia

**Ineffective and insufficient Erythropoiesis**

<i>Ineffective erythropoiesis </i> refers to the production of erythroid precursor cells that are defective. These defective precursors often undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the bone marrow before they have a chance to mature to the reticulocyte stage and be released into the peripheral circulation.

Several conditions involve ineffective erythropoiesis as a mechanism of anemia:

    Megaloblastic anemia: Impaired DNA synthesis due to vitamin B₁₂ or folate deficiency

    Thalassemia: Deficient globin chain synthesis

    Sideroblastic anemia: Deficient protoporphyrin synthesis

In these anemias, peripheral blood hemoglobin concentration is low, which triggers increased erythropoietin production and erythropoietic activity. Although the RBC production rate is high, it is ineffective as many defective erythroid precursors undergo destruction in the bone marrow. The end result is decreased circulating RBCs and anemia.

<i> Insufficient erythropoiesis </i> refers to decreased erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, resulting in reduced RBC production and anemia. Causes include:

Deficiency states:

    Iron deficiency (inadequate intake, malabsorption, chronic bleeding)

    Erythropoietin deficiency (renal disease)

Cellular losses:

    Autoimmune reactions (aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia)

    Infections (parvovirus B19)

Bone marrow infiltration:

    Leukemia cells

    Nonhematopoietic cells (metastatic tumors, granulomas, fibrosis) causing myelophthisic anemia with characteristic teardrop RBCs

**Blood Loss and Hemolysis**

Anemia can also develop as a result of acute blood loss (such as a traumatic injury) or chronic blood loss (such as an intermittently bleeding colonic polyp). Increased hemolysis results in a shortened RBC life span, thus increasing the risk for anemia. Chronic blood loss induces iron deficiency as a cause of anemia. With acute blood loss and excessive hemolysis, the bone marrow takes a few days to increase production of RBCs.

Numerous causes of hemolysis exist, including intrinsic defects in the RBC membrane, enzyme systems, or hemoglobin, or extrinsic causes such as antibody-mediated processes, mechanical fragmentation, or infection-related destruction.
