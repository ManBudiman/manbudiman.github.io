Hemoglobinopathy refers to a disease state (opathy) involving the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule. Hemoglobinopathies are the most common genetic diseases, affecting approximately 7% of the world’s population. Hematologists divide hemoglobinopathies into two categories: structural defects (qualitative) and thalassemias (quantitative). This chapter describes the structural or qualitative defects.

**Globin Biosynthesis**

Six structural genes code for six globin chains. The α- and ζ-globin genes are on the short arm of chromosome 16; the ε-, γ-, δ-, and β-globin gene cluster is on the short arm of chromosome 11. In the human genome, there is one copy of each globin gene per chromatid, for a total of two genes per diploid cell, with the exception of α and γ. There are two copies of the α- and γ-globin genes per chromatid, for a total of four genes per diploid cell.

Hemoglobin changes reflect the sequential activation and inactivation (or switching) of the globin genes, progressing from the ζ- to the α-globin gene on chromosome 16 and from the ε- to the γ-, δ-, and β-globin genes on chromosome 11. The ζ- and ε-globin chains normally appear only during the first 3 months of embryonic development.

**Hemoglobin Assembly**

Affinity
- The α-chain (positively charged) has the highest affinity for the β-chain (negatively charged).
- Next in affinity: γ-chain > δ-chain.
- Two heterodimers (α-β pairs) combine to form a tetramer, completing the hemoglobin molecule.

Hemoglobin Types in Adults
- Hb A (Major Adult Hemoglobin, ~97%): Two α + two β chains.
- Hb A2 (<3.5%): Two α + two δ chains.
	- Low production due to a δ-globin gene promoter mutation.
- Hb F (1–2%): Two α + two γ chains.
	- Found in a small subset of RBCs (F-cells/A-F cells) with uneven distribution.

The types of genetic mutations that occur in the hemoglobinopathies include point mutations, deletions, insertions, and fusions involving one or more of the adult globin genes, namely, α, β, γ, and δ.

## HB S

Hb S is defined by the structural formula α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub><sup>6Glu→Val</sup>, which indicates that on the β chain at position 6, glutamic acid is replaced by valine.

This single amino acid substitution drastically alters hemoglobin’s behavior under low oxygen conditions.

### Sickle Cell Anemia

The term sickle cell disease is used to describe a group of symptomatic hemoglobinopathies that have in common sickle cell formation and the associated crises. Patients with SCD are either homozygous for Hb S (SS) or are compound heterozygotes expressing Hb S in combination with another hemoglobin β chain mutation like Hb C or β-thalassemia. SCDs are the most common form of hemoglobinopathy, with Hb SS and the variants Hb SC and Hb S-β-thalassemia (Hb S-β-thal) occurring most often.

β-Hemoglobin variants are inherited as autosomal codominants, with one gene inherited from each parent. Patients with SCD (Hb SS, Hb SC, or Hb S-β-thal) have inherited a sickle (S) gene from one parent and an S, C, or β-thalassemia gene from the other. 

**Pathophysiology**

In oxygenated states, Hb S remains soluble, and red blood cells (RBCs) maintain a normal biconcave shape. However, upon deoxygenation, the hydrophobic valine at position 6 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket (formed by phenylalanine 85 and leucine 88) on adjacent β-chains, initiating polymerization of Hb S molecules. These polymers form helical fibers, starting with a core of four Hb S tetramers surrounded by 10 additional tetramers, creating long, rigid structures called tactoids. The growing polymers distort RBCs into the classic sickle shape, increasing blood viscosity and impairing microcirculation.

Sickle cells occur in two forms: reversible sickle cells and irreversible sickle cells.

- Reversible sickle cells are Hb S-containing RBCs that change shape in response to oxygen tension. Reversible sickle cells circulate as normal biconcave discs when fully oxygenated but undergo hemoglobin polymerization, show increased viscosity, and change shape on deoxygenation.
- Irreversible sickle cells do not change their shape regardless of the change in oxygen tension or degree of hemoglobin polymerization. These cells are seen on the peripheral blood film as elongated sickle cells with a point at each end. Irreversible sickle cells are likely recognized as abnormal by the spleen and removed from circulation, which prevents them from entering the microcirculation and causing vasoocclusion.

**Clinical Features**

- Vasoocclusive Crisis (VOC): Severe pain (bones, chest, abdomen).
- Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS): Hypoxia, fever, lung infiltrates (leading cause of death).
- Splenic Sequestration: Sudden spleen enlargement → life-threatening anemia.
- Infections: Increased risk (especially pneumococcal, Salmonella osteomyelitis).
- Chronic Organ Damage:
	- Kidneys: Proteinuria, renal failure.
	- Brain: Stroke (11% of children by age 20).
	- Eyes: Retinopathy.
	- Bones: Avascular necrosis (50% by age 35).

**Incidence with Malaria**

The sickle gene occurs with greatest frequency in Central Africa, the Near East, the Mediterranean region, and parts of India. Sickle gene frequency parallels the incidence of P. falciparum and seems to offer some protection against cerebral falciparum malaria in young patients. Malarial parasites are living organisms within the RBCs that use the oxygen within the cells. This reduced oxygen tension causes the cells to sickle, which results in injury to the cells. These injured cells tend to become trapped within the blood vessels of the spleen and other organs, where they are easily phagocytized by scavenger macrophages. Selective destruction of RBCs containing parasites decreases the number of malarial organisms and increases the time for immunity to develop. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the infected cell is uniquely sickled and destroyed, probably in an area of the spleen or liver, where phagocytic cells are plentiful, and the oxygen tension is significantly decreased.

**Laboratory Diagnosis**

The characteristic diagnostic cell observed on a Wright-stained peripheral blood film is a long, curved cell with a point at each end. Because of its appearance, the cell was named a sickle cell.35 The peripheral blood film shows marked poikilocytosis and anisocytosis with normal RBCs, sickle cells, target cells, nucleated RBCs, along with a few spherocytes, basophilic stippling, Pappenheimer bodies, and Howell-Jolly bodies. The presence of sickle cells and target cells is the hallmark of SCD.

**Treatment**

Supportive care has been the mainstay of therapy for SCD and includes adequate hydration, prophylactic vitamin therapy, avoidance of low-oxygen environments, analgesia for pain, and aggressive antibiotic therapy with the first signs of infection.

### Sickle Cell Trait

The term sickle cell trait (SCT) refers to the heterozygous state (Hb AS) and describes a benign condition that generally does not affect mortality or morbidity except under conditions of extreme exertion. It occurs in approximately 8% of African Americans, but also can be found in individuals from Central America, Asia, and the Mediterranean region. Individuals with SCT are generally asymptomatic and present with no significant clinical or hematologic manifestations.

## Hb C

Hb C is defined by the structural formula α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub><sup>6Glu→Lys</sup>, in which lysine replaces glutamic acid in position 6 of the β chain. Lysine has a +1 charge and glutamic acid has a -1 charge, so the result of this substitution is a net change in charge of +2, which has a different structural effect on the hemoglobin molecule and electrophoresis mobility pattern compared with the Hb S substitution.

Homozygous hemoglobin C disease (Hb CC) manifests as a milder disease compared with SCD. Mild splenomegaly and hemolysis may be present. In addition, vasoocclusive crises do not occur. Heterozygous hemoglobin C trait (Hb AC) is asymptomatic.
