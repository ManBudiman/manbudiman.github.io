The root cause of megaloblastic anemia is impaired DNA synthesis. The anemia is named for the very large cells of the bone marrow that develop a distinctive morphology because of a reduction in the number of cell divisions. 

#### Etiology

- **Defect in Megaloblastic Anemia Caused By Deficiency in Folate and Vitamin B12** </br> When either folate or vitamin B12 is deficient, thymidine nucleotide production for DNA synthesis is impaired. Folate deficiency has the more direct effect, ultimately preventing the methylation of dUMP. The effect of vitamin B12 deficiency is more indirect, preventing the production of THF from 5-methyl THF. </br> The resulting DNA is nonfunctional, and the DNA replication process is incomplete. Cell division is halted, resulting in either cell lysis or apoptosis of many erythroid progenitors and precursors within the bone marrow. Cells that survive continue the abnormal maturation with a fewer number of red blood cells (RBCs) released into the circulation. </br> In addition to the increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells in the bone marrow discussed earlier, the remaining erythroid precursors are larger than normally seen during the final stages of erythropoiesis, and their nuclei are immature-appearing compared with the cytoplasm. In contrast to the normally dense chromatin of comparable normoblasts, the nuclei of megaloblastic erythroid precursors have an open, finely stippled, reticular pattern. The nuclear changes seen in the megaloblastic erythroid precursors are related to cell cycle delay, prolonged resting phase, and arrest in nuclear maturation.
- **Other Causes of Megaloblastosis** </br> Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency are not the only causes of megaloblastic erythroid precursors. Dysplastic erythroid precursors in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can also have megaloblastoid features. In MDS, however, the macrocytic erythrocytes and their precursors characteristically show delayed cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation, including cytoplasmic vacuole formation, nuclear budding, multinucleation, and nuclear fragmentation, and thus may be distinguished from the megaloblastic erythroid precursors seen in the vitamin deficiencies. 

#### Manifestations

With either vitamin deficiency, patients may experience general symptoms related to anemia (fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath) and symptoms related to the alimentary tract. Loss of epithelium on the tongue results in a smooth surface and soreness (glossitis). Loss of epithelium along the gastrointestinal tract can result in gastritis, nausea, or constipation.

Although the blood pictures seen with the two vitamin deficiencies are indistinguishable, the clinical presentations vary. After dietary deficiency or malabsorption begins, it takes a few years to develop a vitamin B12 deficiency but only a few months to develop a folate deficiency, reflecting the storage capacity of each vitamin in the body. In vitamin B12 deficiency, neurologic symptoms may be pronounced and may even occur in the absence of anemia.

#### Causes of Vitamin Deficiencies

{{< symptoms_card >}}
Folate Deficiency

- Inadequate Intake
	- Poor diet lacking leafy greens, beans, liver, fortified cereals
	- Heat-sensitive: destroyed by overcooking
- Increased Demand
	- Pregnancy/lactation (fetus/infant needs)
	- Infant/childhood growth spurts
- Impaired Absorption
	- Intestinal disorders (celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn's)
	- Rare genetic defect (PCFT transporter deficiency)
	- Surgical resection of small intestine
- Impaired Utilization
	- Drugs: Methotrexate (chemotherapy), antiseizure meds, antibiotics
	- Inhibit folate metabolism → megaloblastic anemia
- Excessive Loss
	- Renal dialysis (folate lost in dialysate)
	- Minimal physiologic loss via kidneys

Vitamin B12 Deficiency

- Inadequate Intake
	- Vegans (no animal products: meat, eggs, dairy)
	- Elderly with restricted diets
- Increased Demand
	- Pregnancy/lactation
	- Rapid growth phases
- Impaired Absorption (Most common cause)
	- Pernicious anemia: Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells → no intrinsic factor
	- Gastric surgery: Loss of acid/pepsin for B12 release from food
	- Pancreatic insufficiency: No trypsin to cleave R-proteins
	- Ileal dysfunction: Crohn's disease, resection (cubam receptor site)
- Transport Defects
	- Transcobalamin II deficiency (impaired cellular uptake)
	- Haptocorrin abnormalities (increased plasma binding)

#### Laboratory Diagnosis

- MCV: ↑ MCV, typically 100–150 fL
- Pancytopenia: Low Hb/Hct, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
- Reticulocytopenia: Ineffective erythropoopoiesis → few young RBCs
- Hb: often <7–8 g/dL at diagnosis (chronic progression)
- RDW: Elevated (anisocytosis)
- MCH: Increased (due to cell size) | MCHC: Normal (HgB concentration unaffected)
- Hypersegmented Neutrophils (>5 lobes)
- Megaloblasts: Large, immature RBC precursors 
- Hemolytic Markers:
	- ↑ Indirect bilirubin (from RBC breakdown)
	- ↑ LDH (RBC-derived, released during marrow apoptosis)

#### Treatment

- Medicines:
	- Cobalamin parenteral 1000 mcg/day for 1 week
	- Folic acid 1-5 mg/day/orally for 3-4 weeks

- Nutrition
	- Food high in B12 (not present in vegetables) such as:
		- Meat, liver, kidney, clams, fish
		- Eggs, cheese, and other dairy products
	- Food high in folic acid such as:
		- Green leafy vegetables
		- Broccoli
		- Fruit
		- Whole grains
		- Dairy products
