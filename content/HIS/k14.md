#### Etiology

Can develop when there is:
- **Inadequate intake** </br> Each day, approximately 1 mg of iron is lost from the body, mainly in the mitochondria of desquamated skin and sloughed intestinal epithelium. Daily replacement of 1 mg of iron from the diet maintains iron balance and supplies the body’s need for RBC production as long as there is no other source of loss. When the iron in the diet is consistently inadequate, over time the body’s stores of iron become depleted. Ultimately, RBC production slows to manage the iron needs for other body cells.
- **Increased need relative to iron supply** </br> This is the case in periods of rapid growth, such as infancy (especially in prematurity), childhood, and adolescence. For example, although both infants and adult men need about 1 mg/day of iron, that corresponds to a much higher amount per kilogram of body weight for the infant. Pregnancy and nursing place similar demands on the mother’s body to provide iron for the developing fetus or nursing infant in addition to her own iron needs.
- **Impaired absorption** </br> Even when the diet is adequate in iron, the inability to absorb that iron through the enterocyte into the blood will, over time, result in a deficiency of iron in the body. The impairments may be pathologic, as with malabsorption caused by celiac disease. </br> In addition, diseases that decrease stomach acidity impair iron absorption by decreasing the conversion of dietary ferric iron to the absorbable ferrous form. Decrease in stomach acidity also caused by aging, gastrectomy, bariatric surgery, and medications.
- **Chronic blood loss** </br> A fourth way iron deficiency develops is with repeated blood donations, chronic hemorrhage, or hemolysis that results in the loss of small amounts of heme iron from the body over a prolonged period. Anemia develops when the iron loss exceeds iron intake over time and the storage iron is exhausted.

#### Epidemiology

Iron deficiency anemia disproportionately affects specific populations due to physiological demands, dietary patterns, and pathological conditions. **Menstruating women** face particularly high risk, as monthly blood loss increases iron requirements beyond what typical diets provide. **Adolescent girls** experience compounded vulnerability, balancing growth-related iron needs with menstrual losses. Without proper supplementation, **pregnancy and lactation** can deplete maternal iron stores by approximately 1,200 mg, potentially leading to iron-deficient fetuses, especially with closely spaced pregnancies.

**Children** represent another high-risk group due to the iron demands of growth, including needs for cytochromes, myoglobin, and expanded hemoglobin mass. Infants transition from fetal iron stores to dietary sources around six months of age, yet common practices like reliance on cow’s milk (iron-poor) or unsupplemented breastfeeding often fail to meet requirements. Socioeconomic factors further exacerbate dietary inadequacies in this population.

In contrast, iron deficiency is uncommon in men and postmenopausal women without underlying pathology, given the body’s efficient iron conservation. Cases in these groups should prompt investigation for gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., ulcers, malignancies, hemorrhoids) or medication effects (e.g., NSAID-induced gastritis, alcohol use). **Elderly** individuals may develop deficiency due to age-related factors like reduced gastric acidity, impaired absorption, or inadequate diets. Globally, parasitic infections (e.g., hookworms, Schistosoma) contribute significantly through chronic blood loss.

Notably, athletes—particularly soldiers and long-distance runners—may experience exercise-induced hemoglobinuria ("march hemoglobinuria"), where repetitive foot trauma causes low-grade hemolysis and urinary iron loss. While rare, recurrent episodes can culminate in deficiency, though trained athletes often adapt to mitigate this risk.

#### Treatment

The first therapy for iron deficiency is to treat any underlying contributing cause, such as hookworms, tumors, or ulcers. As in the treatment of simple nutritional deficiencies or increased need, dietary supplementation is necessary to replenish the body’s iron stores. 

Oral supplements of ferrous sulfate are the standard prescription.
