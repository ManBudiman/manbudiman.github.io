### Complete Blood Count

To detect the presence of anemia, the medical laboratory professional performs a complete blood count (CBC) using an automated blood cell analyzer to determine the RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, RBC indices, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The RBC indices include the mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration(MCHC).

	- RBC count = Number of red blood cells per microliter (μL) of blood
	- Hemoglobin concentration = Concentration of oxygen-carrying protein in blood (g/dL)
	- Hematocrit = Percentage of blood volume occupied by RBCs
	- Mean Cell Volume (MCV) = Average size of RBCs (femtoliters, fL)
	- Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH) = Average amount of hemoglobin per RBC (picograms, pg)
	- Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) = Average hemoglobin concentration per RBC (g/dL)
	- Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) = Variation in RBC size

### Reticulocyte Count

The reticulocyte count serves as an important tool to assess the bone marrow’s ability to increase RBC production in response to an anemia. Reticulocytes are young RBCs that lack a nucleus but still contain residual ribonucleic acid (RNA) to complete the production of hemoglobin. Normally they circulate peripherally for only 1 day while completing their development. The adult reference interval for the reticulocyte count is 0.5% to 2.5% expressed as a percentage of the total number of RBCs.

Analysis of the reticulocyte count plays a crucial role in determining whether an anemia is due to an RBC production defect or to premature hemolysis and shortened survival defect. If there is shortened RBC survival, as in the hemolytic anemias, the bone marrow tries to compensate by increasing RBC production to release more reticulocytes into the peripheral circulation.

### Peripheral Blood Film Examination

An important component in the evaluation of an anemia is examination of the peripheral blood film, with particular attention to RBC diameter, shape, color, and inclusions. The peripheral blood film also serves to verify the results produced by automated analyzers.

Normal RBCs on a Wright-stained blood film are nearly uniform, ranging from 7 to 8 mm in diameter. Small or microcytic cells are less than 6 mm in diameter and large or macrocytic RBCs are greater than 8 mm in diameter. Certain shape abnormalities of diagnostic value (such as sickle cells, spherocytes, schistocytes, and oval macrocytes) and RBC inclusions (such as malarial parasites, basophilic stippling, and Howell-Jolly bodies) can be detected only by studying the RBCs on a peripheral blood film

### Bone Marrow Examination

When the cause cannot be determined, however, or the differential diagnosis remains broad, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may help in establishing the cause of anemia. Bone marrow examination is indicated for a patient with an unexplained anemia associated with or without other cytopenias, fever of unknown origin, or suspected hematologic neoplasm.

Bone marrow examination evaluates hematopoiesis and can determine whether there is an infiltration of abnormal cells into the bone marrow.
