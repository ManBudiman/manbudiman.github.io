The hematopoietic system is responsible for the **continuous replacement** of blood cells, which have a finite lifespan, through a process called hemopoiesis (or hematopoiesis). This process involves the formation of blood cells from established precursors. The term "hemopoiesis" originates from the Greek words haima (blood) and poiein (to make).

### Hematopoiesis Across Lifespans

In the fetus, hematopoietic niches are present

> During the 1st trimester, islands of hematopoiesis are found in the **yolk sac**, developing from hemangioblasts into both hematopoietic and endothelial cells

> In the 2nd trimester, hematopoiesis shifts to **the liver and then the spleen**

> By the 7th month of gestation, **the bone marrow** becomes the primary site of hematopoiesis, a role it **maintains throughout adulthood**

In adults, the approximate volume of marrow is 1.7 liters, containing about 10^12 hematopoietic cells
> This highly active system produces approximately 1 x 10^9 red blood cells (RBCs) and 1 x 10^8 leukocytes every hour. The daily production rates in human bone marrow are about 3 x 10^9 erythrocytes/kg/day and 0.85 x 10^9 granulocytes/kg/day

### Stem Cells, Growth Factors, and Differentiation

All blood cells originate from a single type of stem cell in the bone marrow, known as pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
.
The formation of blood cells involves two key processes:
1. Differentiation: This is the progressive acquisition of biochemical, functional, and morphological characteristics specific to a particular cell type. Differentiation occurs at all stages of hematopoiesis. The mechanisms that control whether an HSC self-renews or differentiates are still a mystery, though many important regulatory players have been identified.

2. Cell Proliferation: This involves the production of a large number of mature cells from a single cell committed to one or more differentiation pathways. It occurs in hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells (with the exception of the megakaryocytic lineage), and precursor cells.

Hematopoietic cells form a hierarchy:

- Stem cells (HSCs) are pluripotential, meaning they can give rise to all blood cells. They divide to renew their own cell population and to form progenitor cells, marking the beginning of blood cell formation. Stem cells divide at a rate only sufficient to maintain their relatively small population. They are capable of self-renewal

- Progenitor cells have less potentiality than stem cells and are committed to forming one or two blood cell lines. They exhibit high mitotic activity, dividing to reproduce themselves and to form precursor cells. Progenitor cells divide asymmetrically to produce both progenitor and precursor cells. Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells, also called Colony-forming Units (CFUs) or Colony Forming Cells (CFCs), are characterized by their ability to form colonies containing cells of one or more hematopoietic lineages. They can be multipotent, tripotent, bipotent, or unipotent. Examples include:

	- Multipotent: CFU-GEMM, which generates granulocytes, erythroblasts, macrophages, and megakaryocytes.

	- Tripotent: CFU-E mega baso, generating erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, and basophil granulocytes.

	- Bipotent: CFU-GM (generates granulocytes and macrophages) and CFU-E mega (generates erythroblasts and megakaryocytes).

	- Unipotent: CFUG (neutrophil granulocytes), CFU-eo (eosinophil granulocytes), CFU-baso (basophil granulocytes), CFU-M (macrophages), CFU-E (erythroblasts), and CFU-mega (megakaryocytes).

- Precursor cells (or blast cells) are cells that begin morphological differentiation and display characteristics of the mature blood cells they will form, but they are not self-renewing. They produce only cells on the path to differentiation. Precursor cells are responsible for the generation of distinct cell lineages.

- Maturing cells result from the differentiation of the committed precursor cell population.

### Hematopoietic Growth Factors (HGFs)
HGFs are glycoproteins produced in the bone marrow by endothelial cells, stromal cells, fibroblasts, developing lymphocytes, and macrophages. They can also be produced outside the bone marrow. Their main actions include:

1. Stimulating proliferation of immature cells.

2. Supporting the differentiation of maturing cells.

3. Extending the lifespan and enhancing the functions of mature cells.

HGFs act through a mechanism where a ligand binds to a receptor, leading to a conformational change, activation of intracellular kinases, and the final induction of cell proliferation. Hematopoietic cells develop distinct patterns of growth factor receptors as they differentiate.
There are three major groups of HGFs:

1. Colony Stimulating Factors (CSFs): These stimulate committed precursor cells to grow in vitro into cell colonies.

	- G-CSF: A glycoprotein produced by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages, which increases neutrophils. Synthetic forms include filgrastim or lenograstim.

	- GM-CSF: A glycoprotein produced by endothelial cells, T cells, fibroblasts, and monocytes, which increases the formation of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Synthetic forms include sargramostim and molgramostim.

2. Erythropoietin & Thrombopoietin.

3. Cytokines (primarily interleukins): Produced by leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes), these act through paracrine and autocrine mechanisms.

	- IL3: Stimulates proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and acts together with other growth factors.

	- IL5: Promotes eosinophil progeny.
	
	- Interleukins generally have relevant functions in the formation and function of B and T cells.

### The Bone Marrow
The bone marrow is a large and complex organ found in the medullary canals of long bones and in the cavities of cancellous bone.
There are two types of bone marrow:

- Red (hematogenous) bone marrow: Contains blood and blood-forming cells. All newborns have red bone marrow, which converts to yellow bone marrow during growth.

- Yellow bone marrow: Contains adipose cells.

The total mass of adult bone marrow ranges from 1600 to 3700 grams, consisting of approximately 50% fatty marrow and 50% hematopoietically active marrow.
The functions of bone marrow include:

- Site of hematopoiesis (in the hematopoietic marrow).

- Source of mesenchymal stem cells, which can differentiate into various other cell types such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes, chondrocytes, skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, kidney cells, and neural cell lineages.

- Large store of reserve lipid (in the fatty marrow).

- Phagocytosis and degradation of circulating particulate material, including microorganisms and abnormal or senescent red cells and leukocytes.

- Antibody production.

- Destruction of worn-out RBCs.

- Storage of iron derived from the breakdown of hemoglobin.

The hematopoietic marrow is labile and alters rapidly in response to many stimuli. It is composed of:

- Stroma: A meshwork of specialized fibroblastic cells (reticular or adventitial cells) and a delicate web of reticular fibers supporting hemopoietic cells and macrophages. The matrix of bone marrow also contains collagen type I, proteoglycans, fibronectin, and laminin, which are glycoproteins interacting with integrins to bind cells to the matrix.

- Hemopoietic cords or islands of cells.

- Sinusoidal capillaries.

The bone marrow has two main compartments:

- The Marrow Stromal Compartment: This is a framework of adipose cells, fibroblasts, stromal cells, vascular endothelial cells, and blood vessels.

- Endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stromal cells produce hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines that regulate blood production.

- Endothelial cells form a barrier between the marrow and blood.

- Adipose cells provide a local source and synthesize growth factors.

- Macrophages are involved in removal and phagocytosis.

- Osteoblasts and osteoclasts maintain and remodel the cancellous bone surrounding the marrow tissue.

- The Hematopoietic Cell Compartment: This compartment is highly vascularized and contains the hematopoietic stem cells, committed precursor cells, and maturing cells.

The release of mature blood cells from the red bone marrow is regulated by releasing factors such as C3, hormones, and some bacterial toxins.
