<p>Aplastic anemia is a rare but potentially fatal bone marrow failure syndrome. The characteristic features of aplastic anemia include pancytopenia, reticulocytopenia, bone marrow hypocellularity, and depletion of hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 80% to 85% of aplastic anemia cases are acquired, whereas 15% to 20% are inherited/congenital.</p>
<h2 id="acquired-aplastic-anemia">Acquired Aplastic Anemia</h2>
<p>Acquired aplastic anemia is classified into two major categories: </br> Idiopathic and secondary. Idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia has no known cause. Secondary acquired aplastic anemia is associated with an identified cause. Approximately 70% of all aplastic anemia cases are idiopathic, whereas 10% to 15% are secondary.</p>
<p>Aplastic anemia can occur at any age, with peak incidence at 15 to 25 years and the second highest frequency at older than 60 years. There is no gender predisposition.</p>
<p><strong>Acquired Aplastic Anemia (80%–85% of Cases)</strong></p>

	Dose-dependent/Predictable Causes

		Chemicals:
			Insecticides
			Cutting/lubricating oils
		Viruses:
			Epstein-Barr virus
			Hepatitis virus (non-A, non-B, non-C, non-G)
			Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

	Miscellaneous Conditions
		Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
		Autoimmune diseases
		Pregnancy

<p><strong>Inherited/Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (15%–20% of Cases)</strong></p>
<pre><code>Fanconi anemia

Dyskeratosis congenita

Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>
<p>As the name indicates, the cause of idiopathic aplastic anemia is unknown. Secondary aplastic anemia is associated with exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, radiation, or infections. Cytotoxic drugs, radiation, and benzenes are responsible for 10% of secondary aplastic anemia cases and suppress the bone marrow in a predictable, dose-dependent manner. Depending on the dose and exposure duration, the bone marrow generally recovers after withdrawal of the agent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, approximately 70% of cases of secondary aplastic anemia occur as a result of idiosyncratic reactions to drugs or chemicals.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>
<p>The pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anemia centers on the profound depletion and dysfunction of hematopoietic stem cells. At the core of the disease is a quantitative and qualitative deficiency of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which typically comprise less than 10% of normal levels in affected patients. These remaining stem cells demonstrate impaired colony-forming capacity in culture and exhibit increased expression of Fas receptors that promote programmed cell death.</p>
<p>The stem cell depletion occurs through two principal mechanisms. First, an autoimmune attack mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes targets and destroys hematopoietic stem cells. This immune-mediated damage is evidenced by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the bone marrow microenvironment, which both inhibit blood cell production and induce stem cell apoptosis. Second, direct injury to stem cells can result from exposure to DNA-damaging agents including chemotherapy drugs, radiation, certain viruses (particularly hepatitis viruses and Epstein-Barr virus), and toxic chemicals like benzene.</p>
<p>Despite the near absence of functioning stem cells, the bone marrow stromal environment remains intact and actually overproduces hematopoietic growth factors. Patients show markedly elevated levels of erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and FLT3 ligand (the latter reaching concentrations up to 200 times normal). This paradoxical overproduction of growth factors proves ineffective at restoring blood cell production because the target stem cell population is either absent or non-functional.</p>
<p>The autoimmune nature of most cases is further supported by the clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy, with approximately two-thirds of patients showing hematologic improvement after treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. The remaining non-responders likely have either irreversible stem cell depletion or additional pathologic mechanisms contributing to their pancytopenia. This pathophysiology explains the characteristic clinical findings of pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow despite elevated circulating growth factor levels.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Severe acquired aplastic anemia requires immediate attention to prevent serious complications. If a causative agent is identified, its use should be discontinued. Blood product replacement should be given judiciously to avoid alloimmunization.8 Platelets should not be transfused at counts greater than 10,000/mL, unless the patient is bleeding.</p>
<p>One of the most important early decisions is determining whether the patient is a candidate for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia who are younger than 40 years of age and have an HLA-identical sibling.</p>
<h2 id="inheritadcongenital-bone-marrow-failure-syndromes">Inheritad/Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes</h2>
<p>The three most common inherited/congenital bone marrow failure disorders associated with pancytopenia are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome.</p>
<h3 id="fanconi-anemia">Fanconi anemia</h3>
<p>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (1-5 cases per million) characterized by chromosomal instability, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. First described in 1927, this autosomal recessive disorder (except X-linked FANCB subtype) involves mutations in any of 21 FANC genes (most commonly FANCA at 60% prevalence), with a carrier frequency of 1:300 (higher in Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Congenital anomalies (present in ~66% of patients): Skeletal abnormalities (thumb/radial defects, scoliosis), skin pigmentation changes, short stature, and genitourinary malformations</li>
<li>Hematologic manifestations: Progressive pancytopenia typically emerges between ages 5-10 years, often beginning with thrombocytopenia and macrocytosis</li>
<li>Cancer predisposition: 800-fold increased risk of AML, 700-fold increased head/neck cancers, and extreme risks for squamous cell carcinomas (vulvar, esophageal)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> </br>
FA proteins form a DNA repair pathway that responds to cross-linking damage. The nuclear core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M) activates the ID complex (FANCD2/I), which recruits effector proteins (BRCA2, PALB2, etc.) to repair DNA. Defects cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromosomal breakage with DEB/MMC sensitivity</li>
<li>Accelerated telomere shortening</li>
<li>Oxidative stress hypersensitivity</li>
<li>S-phase cell cycle delays</li>
</ul>
