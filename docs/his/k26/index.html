<p>Hemostasis involves the interaction of vasoconstriction, platelet adhesion and aggregation, and coagulation enzyme activation to stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Whenever a vessel is severed or ruptured, hemostasis is achieved by several mechanisms: (1) vascular constriction; (2) formation of a platelet plug; (3) formation of a blood clot as a result of blood coagulation; and (4) eventual growth of fibrous tissue into the blood clot to close the hole in the vessel permanently.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<h3 id="vascular-constriction">Vascular Constriction</h3>
<p>Trauma to the vessel wall causes smooth muscle in the wall to contract; this instantaneously reduces the flow of blood from the ruptured vessel. The contraction results from the following: (1) local myogenic spasm; (2) local autacoid factors from the traumatized tissues, vascular endothelium, and blood platelets; and (3) nervous reflexes.</p>
<p>The nervous reflexes are initiated by pain nerve impulses or other sensory impulses that originate from the traumatized vessel or nearby tissues. However, even more vasoconstriction probably results from local <i> myogenic contraction </i> of the blood vessels initiated by direct damage to the vascular wall. And, for the smaller vessels, the platelets are responsible for much of the vasoconstriction by releasing a vasoconstrictor substance, <i> thromboxane A2. </i></p>
<h3 id="platelet-plug-formation">Platelet Plug formation</h3>
<p>If the cut in the blood vessel is very small—many very small vascular holes develop throughout the body each day—the cut is often sealed by a platelet plug rather than by a blood clot.</p>
<p>On the platelet cell membrane surface is a coat of glycoproteins that repulses adherence to normal endothelium and yet causes adherence to injured areas of the vessel wall, especially to injured endothelial cells and even more so to any exposed collagen from deep within the vessel wall.</p>
<ol>
<li>Platelet come in contact with a damaged vascular surface</li>
<li>They begin to swell, they assume irregular forms with numerous irradiating pseudopods protruding from their surfaces</li>
<li>The platelet surface glycoproteins bind to vWF in the exposed matrix below the damaged endothelium. The platelets then secrete increased quantities of ADP and platelet-activating factor (PAF), and their enzymes form thromboxane A2</li>
<li>Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and, along with ADP and PAF, acts on nearby platelets to activate them as well</li>
<li>It attract more and more additional platelets, thus forming a platelet plug</li>
</ol>
<p>The platelet-plugging mechanism is extremely important for closing minute ruptures in very small blood vessels that occur many thousands of times daily.</p>
<h3 id="blood-coagulation">Blood Coagulation</h3>
<p>The clot begins to develop in 15 to 20 seconds if the trauma to the vascular wall is severe and in 1 to 2 minutes if the trauma is minor. Activator substances from the traumatized vascular wall, from platelets, and from blood proteins adhering to the traumatized vascular wall initiate the clotting process</p>
<p>Once a blood clot starts to develop, it normally extends within minutes into the surrounding blood—that is, the clot initiates a positive feedback to promote more clotting. One of the most important causes of this clot promotion is that the proteolytic action of thrombin allows it to act on many of the other blood- clotting factors in addition to fibrinogen.</p>
<h4 id="initiaton-of-coagulation">Initiaton of Coagulation</h4>
<p>These mechanisms are set into play by the following: (1) trauma to the vascular wall and adjacent tissues; (2) trauma to the blood; or (3) contact of the blood with damaged endothelial cells or with collagen and other tissue elements outside the blood vessel. In each case, this leads to the formation of prothrombin activator, which then causes prothrombin conversion to thrombin and all the subsequent clotting steps.</p>
<p>Prothrombin activator is generally considered to be formed in two ways, although, in reality, the two ways interact constantly with each other: (1) by the extrinsic pathway that begins with trauma to the vascular wall and surrounding tissues; and (2) by the intrinsic pathway that begins in the blood.</p>

<p>Except for the first two steps in the intrinsic pathway, calcium ions are required for promotion or acceleration of all the blood- clotting reactions. Therefore, in the absence of calcium ions, blood clotting by either pathway does not occur.</p>
<h3 id="fibrous-organization-or-dissolution-of-blood-clots">Fibrous Organization or Dissolution of Blood Clots</h3>
<p>Once a blood clot has formed, it can follow one of two courses: (1) it can become invaded by fibroblasts, which subsequently form connective tissue all through the clot; or (2) it can dissolve.</p>
<p>The usual course for a clot that forms in a small hole of a vessel wall is invasion by fibroblasts, beginning within a few hours after the clot is formed, which is promoted at least partially by growth factor secreted by platelets.</p>
<p>Conversely, when excess blood has leaked into the tissues, and tissue clots have formed where they are not needed, special substances in the clot usually become activated. These substances function as enzymes to dissolve the clot.</p>
<p>The plasma proteins contain a euglobulin called plasminogen (profibrinolysin) that when activated, becomes a substance called plasmin (fibrinolysin). When a clot is formed, a large amount of plasminogen is trapped in the clot, along with other plasma proteins. This will not become plasmin or cause lysis of the clot until it is activated. The injured tissues and vascular endothelium very slowly release a powerful activator called tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA); a few days later, after the clot has stopped the bleeding, t-PA eventually converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn removes the remaining unnecessary blood clot</p>
