<h2 id="hemorrhage-in-the-newborn-infant">Hemorrhage in the Newborn Infant</h2>
<p>Congenital and acquired bleeding disorders can manifest at varying times in infants and older children.
Hemorrhage in an otherwise healthy newborn may suggest an inherited coagulation defect (e.g., hemophilia) or concurrent thrombocytopenia.
Bleeding in otherwise sick neonates is frequently caused by underproduction or consumption of coagulation factors and/or platelets.
Common acquired hemorrhagic disorders include hemorrhage due to vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.</p>
<h3 id="hemorrhagic-disease-of-the-newborn">Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn</h3>
<p>Bleeding from vitamin K deficiency, otherwise known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, results from transient but profound deficiencies in vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors.</p>
<p>The disease process most often affects exclusively breastfed infants who did not receive intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. Maternal breastmilk lacks free vitamin K, and newborns lack the intestinal flora normally responsible for vitamin K synthesis. Premature infants with nutritional deficiencies are also at risk of vitamin K deficiency and bleeding.</p>
<p>Intramuscular administration of 1 mg vitamin K1 (phytonadione) soon after birth can prevent bleeding complications from vitamin K deficiency in most full- term infants.</p>
<h3 id="disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic">Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)</h3>
<p>In neonates and other patients, DIC can result in either bleeding or thrombosis. DIC occurs secondary to an array of primary processes, including but not limited to sepsis or asphyxia. Rarely, hemangiomas will cause consumption of coagulation factors and initiate this process. In addition to clinical context, coagulation studies, factor levels, and platelet counts can provide evidence of ongoing DIC.</p>
<p>Management centers on treatment of the underlying etiology, although supportive care may include blood, plasma, vitamin K, or platelet transfusions to replace consumed factors.</p>
<h2 id="hemophilia">Hemophilia</h2>
<h3 id="hemophilia-a">Hemophilia A</h3>
<p>Hemophilia A, the most common hereditary disease associated with life-threatening bleeding, is caused by mutations in factor VIII, an essential cofactor for factor IX in the coagulation cascade. Hemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and thus affects mainly males and homozygous females.</p>
<p>Hemophilia A exhibits a wide range of clinical severity that correlates well with the level of factor VIII activity. Those with less than 1% of normal levels have severe disease; those with 2% to 5% of normal levels have moderately severe disease; and those with 6% to 50% of normal levels have mild disease.</p>
<p>Patients with hemophilia A have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT, results that point to an abnormality of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Factor VIII–specific assays are required for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Hemophilia A is treated with infusions of recombinant factor VIII.</p>
<h3 id="hemophilia-b">Hemophilia B</h3>
<p>Severe factor IX deficiency produces a disorder clinically indistinguishable from factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A).</p>
<p>Like hemophilia A, it is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and shows variable clinical severity. As with hemophilia A, the PTT is prolonged and the PT is normal. Diagnosis is possible only by assay of the factor levels. The disease is treated with infusions of recombinant factor IX.</p>
