<p>A major function of RBCs, also known as erythrocytes, is to transport hemoglobin, which, in turn, carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. In some animals, including many invertebrates, hemoglobin circulates as free protein in the circulatory fluids and is not enclosed in RBCs. When it is free in human plasma, about 3% of it leaks through the capillary membrane into the tissue spaces or through the glomerular membrane of the kidney into the glomerular filtrate each time the blood passes through the capillaries. Therefore, hemoglobin must remain inside RBCs to perform its functions in humans effectively.</p>
<p>The RBCs have other functions besides transport of hemoglobin. For example, they contain a large quantity of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction between carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), increasing the rate of this reaction several thousandfold. The rapidity of this reaction makes it possible for the water of the blood to transport enormous quantities of CO₂ in the form of bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻) from the tissues to the lungs, where it is reconverted to CO₂ and expelled into the atmosphere as a body waste product. The hemoglobin in the cells is an excellent acid-base buffer (as is true of most proteins), so the RBCs are responsible for most of the acid-base buffering power of whole blood.</p>
<p><i> Our blood volume is 8% of body weight, with 55% of its volume made up of plasma. It has the pH level of 7.35-7.45, and temperature of 38 degree celcius. </i></p>
<p>Normal RBCs are biconcave discs having a mean diameter of about 7.8 micrometers and a thickness of 2.5 micrometers at the thickest point and 1 micrometer or less in the center. The average volume of the RBC is 90 to 95 cubic micrometers.</p>
<p>The shapes of RBCs can change remarkably as the cells squeeze through capillaries. Actually, the RBC resembles a bag that can be deformed into almost any shape. Furthermore, because the normal cell has a great excess of cell membrane for the quantity of material inside, deformation does not stretch the membrane greatly and, consequently, does not rupture the cell, as would be the case with many other cells.</p>
<h3 id="production-of-red-blood-cells">Production of Red Blood Cells</h3>
<p>In the early weeks of embryonic life, primitive nucleated RBCs are produced in the yolk sac. During the middle trimester of gestation, the liver becomes the main organ for RBC production, though significant numbers are also produced in the spleen and lymph nodes. By the last month of gestation and after birth, RBC production shifts exclusively to the bone marrow.</p>

<p>The marrow of nearly all bones produces RBCs until about 5 years of age. After this period, changes occur in bone marrow activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The marrow of long bones (except for the proximal humeri and tibiae) becomes fatty and ceases RBC production by around 20 years of age.</li>
<li>Beyond this age, RBC production is primarily confined to the marrow of membranous bones, including the vertebrae, sternum, ribs, and ilia.</li>
<li>Even in these bones, marrow productivity gradually declines with age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Erythropoietin</strong> </br> The principal stimulus for RBC production in a low oxygen state is a circulating hormone called erythropoietin, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 34,000. In the absence of erythropoietin, hypoxia has little or no effect to stimulate RBC production. However, when the erythropoietin system is functional, hypoxia causes a marked increase in erythropoietin production and the erythropoietin, in turn, enhances RBC production until the hypoxia is relieved.</p>
<p>Normally, about 90% of all erythropoietin is formed in the kidneys, and the remainder is formed mainly in the liver. Renal tissue hypoxia leads to increased tissue levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which serves as a transcription factor for a large number of hypoxia-inducible genes, including the erythropoietin gene. HIF-1 binds to a hypoxia response element in the erythropoietin gene, inducing transcription of messenger RNA and, ultimately, increased erythropoietin synthesis.</p>

<p>When both kidneys are removed from a person, or when the kidneys are destroyed by renal disease, the person invariably becomes very anemic. This is because the 10% of the normal erythropoietin formed in other tissues (mainly in the liver) is sufficient to cause only one third to half the RBC formation needed by the body.</p>
<p><i> When an animal or person is placed in an atmosphere of low oxygen, erythropoietin begins to be formed within minutes to hours, and it reaches maximum production within 24 hours. Yet, almost no new RBCs appear in the circulating blood until about 5 days later. </i></p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-folic-acid-and-b12-for-maturation">The Importance of Folic Acid and B12 for Maturation</h3>
<p>Both these vitamins are essential for synthesis of DNA because each, in a different way, is required for formation of thymidine triphosphate, one of the essential building blocks of DNA. Therefore, lack of vitamin B₁₂ or folic acid causes abnormal and diminished DNA and, consequently, failure of nuclear maturation and cell division.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the erythroblastic cells of the bone marrow, in addition to failing to proliferate rapidly, produce mainly larger than normal RBCs called macrocytes, which have a flimsy membrane and are often irregular, large, and oval instead of the usual biconcave disc.</p>
<p>These poorly formed cells, after entering the circulating blood, are capable of carrying oxygen normally, but their fragility causes them to have a short life, half to one-third normal. Therefore, deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ or folic acid causes maturation failure in the process of erythropoiesis.</p>
<h3 id="hematocrit">Hematocrit</h3>
<p>Hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of packed RBCs to the volume of whole blood and is manually determined by transferring blood to a plastic tube with a uniform bore, centrifuging, measuring the column of RBCs, and dividing by the total length of the column of RBCs plus plasma.7 The normal ratio approaches 50%. Hematocrit is also called packed cell volume (PCV), the packed cells referring to RBCs. Often one can see a light-colored layer between the RBCs and plasma. This is the buffy coat and contains WBCs and platelets, and it is excluded from the hematocrit determination.</p>
